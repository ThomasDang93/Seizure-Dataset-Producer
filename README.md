# Seizure-Dataset-Producer
This program parses file recordings of epileptic seizures and uses an algorithm to filter out any noisy data that the parser comes across. This tool allows configurable parameters that enable the end user to produce custom datasets for the purposes of machine learning implementations on seizure predictions.
